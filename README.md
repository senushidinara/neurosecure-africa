🧠 NeuroSecure Africa
AI-Powered Neurodata Monitoring for Early Memory Loss Prediction
NeuroSecure Africa is a cutting-edge, AI-powered wearable system designed to predict early memory loss by analyzing brain activity during sleep. The project focuses on securing sensitive neurodata and ensuring widespread access across Africa through integrated FinTech solutions.
💡 Project Summary
The system integrates EEG/MEG data analysis, advanced machine learning, and mobile connectivity to provide personalized, timely risk assessments and actionable interventions. Our core principles are data privacy (local processing) and affordability (micro-payment/insurance integration).
🚀 How It Functions
 * Data Acquisition: Wearable EEG Headband captures brainwave data (gamma, theta, REM, non-REM).
 * Data Preprocessing: Signals are cleaned, normalized, and segmented into sleep cycles.
 * AI/ML Analysis: Proprietary REM Fingerprinting identifies unique neural signatures, and Predictive Models assess hippocampal stress and memory loss risk.
 * Security & Encryption: All sensitive neurodata is encrypted with AES-256 and processed primarily on the device.
 * Mobile Integration: Results, reports, and FinTech options are delivered via a secure smartphone app (iOS/Android).
