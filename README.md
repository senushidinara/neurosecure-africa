**🧠 NeuroSecure Africa — AI-Powered Neurodata Monitoring for Early Memory Loss Prediction**

**Author:** `senushidinara` (Senushi Dinara)

NeuroSecure Africa is a cutting-edge, AI-powered wearable system designed to predict early memory loss by analysing brain activity during sleep. The project is built around strong principles of **data privacy** (local/device-first processing) and **affordability** across Africa via integrated FinTech options (micropayments / insurance).

---

## 💡 Project Summary

The system integrates EEG/MEG data acquisition, advanced signal processing, and machine learning to deliver personalized risk assessments and actionable interventions. Core principles:

- **Privacy-first:** Sensitive neurodata is encrypted and processed primarily on-device.  
- **Affordable access:** FinTech integration to provide micro-payments and insurance-backed access.  
- **Clinical-minded:** REM fingerprinting and hippocampal-stress models to flag early memory-risk signatures.

---

## 🚀 How It Functions

- **Data Acquisition:** Wearable EEG headband captures brainwave bands (gamma, beta, alpha, theta, delta) and REM / non-REM epochs.  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Noise filtering, normalization, and segmentation into sleep cycles.  
- **AI/ML Analysis:** REM fingerprinting and predictive models estimate hippocampal stress and memory-loss risk.  
- **Security & Encryption:** AES-256 for sensitive on-device data; secure sync for optional cloud ops.  
- **Mobile Integration:** iOS/Android app presents results, reports, and FinTech payment options.
